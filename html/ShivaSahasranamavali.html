		<h1 class="my-2 py-2 text-center">Shiva Sahasra Namam - Thousand Names of
		Lord Shiva from Mahabharata</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="verse_desc">
			<p class="author">Translation &amp; Transliteration by P. R. Ramachander</p>
			<p class="qt text-justify text-info">There are two versions of Shiva sahasranama-one in Linga
			Purana (Being taught by Lord Krishna to sage Markandeya) and the other
			which occurs in Anushasanika Parva of Mahabaratha. </p>
			<p class="qt text-justify text-info">In the Mahabaratha version (which I am giving here) Yudishtra
			after hearing the Vishnu Sahasranama from Bheeshma requests him also
			to teach the thousand names of Lord Shiva. Bheeshma expresses his inability
			to the same and requests Lord Krishna to teach it to Yudishtra. Then
			Lord Krishna who has learnt it from Sage Upamanyu teaches it to Yudishtra.
			A bhashya (explanation) for this was written by Sri Chathurthara Neela
			Kanda called “Bharatha bhava pradheepam”. Based on this Sri.N.Subramanya
			Iyer (lovingly called “Anna (elder brother) by his admirers wrote a
			detailed interpretation in Tamil which was published initially by the
			Sarada Peetham, Sringeri. Later they gave the publishing rights to Ramakrishna
			Mutt of Madras. My feeble attempt, to give an English meaning to this
			Shiva Sahasranama is based on this great book. I have not attempted
			to give meaning with interpretation as done in the above book. </p>
			<p class="qt text-justify text-info">This book gives 1008 names of Lord Shiva. While 45 names
			are repeated twice, 11 are repeated thrice and 3 names are repeated
			four times. Readers may observe that different meanings are given to
			these repetitions. </p>

			I salute him who is dear to Mukunda,<br/>
			I salute him who is the refuge of his devotees,<br/>
			Who is the one who gives them great status,<br/>

			<br/>

			Asakthoham gunaan vakthum maha devasya dheematha,<br/>
			Yo hi sarva gatho na cha sarvathra drusyathe. 3<br/>
			<br/>
			Bheeshma replied:-<br/>
			Incapable I am to tell about the properties,<br/>
			Of the great God who is very great,<br/>
			For he is seen everywhere but seen nowhere.<br/>
			<br/>
			Brahma Vishnu suresaanaam srushtaa cha prabhureva cha,<br/>

			<br/>
			He is the one who created Brahma, Vishnu and other devas,<br/>

			He is greater than nature and the masculine concept,<br/>
			He is being meditated upon by great sages who know the truth,<br/>
			He is the causal universe, cause as well as the effect.<br/>

			And have been told by Sage Dandi,<br/>
			Whose heart is immersed in Vedas.<br/>
			<br/>

			And who can grant us heaven,<br/>
			Using those famous , well known names.<br/>
			<br/>

			Sathyai sthath pramam , brhma brhma proktham sanathanam,<br/>
			Vakshye yadu kula sreshta srunushvava hitho mama. 28<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh Chief of the clan of Yadus,<br/>
			Please hear from me with concentration those names<br/>
			Which came from the world of Brahma,<br/>
			Which are found based in the Vedas,<br/>
			Which are every where,<br/>
			And which are truth<br/>
			And I salute that great God who is Brahmam,<br/>
			And is worshipped by Lord Brahma.<br/>
			<br/>
			Varayainam bhavam devam bhakthasthvam parameshvaram,<br/>
			Thena they sraviyishyami yahad brahma sanathanam. 29<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh Krishna , who is his devotee,<br/>
			Please worship that Parameshwara,<br/>
			Who is the source of the world,<br/>
			And Who is the god of gods,<br/>
			And for that purpose,<br/>
			I am making you hear the following.<br/>
			<br/>
			Na sakyam vistharath kruthsnam vakthum sarvasya kenachith,<br/>
			Yukthenaapi vibhoothinaa Mapi varsha sathair api. 30<br/>
			<br/>
			Even though one has all abilities and fame,<br/>
			It is just impossible for them to narrate fully,<br/>
			All the greatness of Shiva even in hundred years.<br/>
			<br/>
			Yasyadhir Madhya mantham cha surair api na gamyahe,<br/>
			Kasthasya shakthuyadwaktham gunaan karsnyena madhava. 31<br/>
			<br/>
			Hey Madhava,, Who will have the ability ,<br/>
			To describe in full, the qualities of him,<br/>
			Whose head or foot was not found by the devas?<br/>
			<br/>
			Kinthu devasya mahatha samkshipthartha padaksharam,<br/>
			Shakthi thascharitham vakshye prasadathasya dheematha. 32<br/>
			<br/>
			In spite of that I would tell you in short,<br/>
			According to my limited capacity,<br/>
			Using limited words and letters,<br/>
			The story of him, who is the source of wisdom,<br/>
			Because of his grace and blessing.<br/>
			<br/>
			Aaprapya thu thatho anugnaam na sakya sthothumeeswara,<br/>
			Yada thennabhyanugnath sthutho vai sa thada maya. 33<br/>
			<br/>
			Since it is not feasible to pray him ,<br/>
			Without his permission and grace,<br/>
			I was able to sing his prayers,<br/>
			When I was blessed by him.<br/>
			<br/>
			Anaadi nidanasyaaham jagadyoner mahatmana,<br/>
			Naamnaam kanchith samudhesyam vakshamya vaktha yonina. 34<br/>

			<br/>
			Dasa nama sahasraani yaanyaaha prapithamaha,<br/>
			Thaani nirmadhya manasa dhadhno druthamivodhbudham. 36<br/>
			<br/>
			These thousand names are the result of churning,<br/>
			Similar to getting butter from curd,<br/>
			Out of the ten thousand names told by Brahma.<br/>
			<br/>
			Gire saaram yadha hema pushpasaaram yadha madhu,<br/>
			Gruthatsaaram yadha mandastha Dhaithath sara samudrutham. 37<br/>
			<br/>
			This essence has been taken after serious thought,<br/>
			Like the gold is taken out of mines,<br/>
			Honey is taken out of flowers,<br/>
			And ghee is taken out of butter.<br/>
			<br/>
			Sarva paapahamidham chathur veda samanvitham,<br/>
			Prayathnenadhi ganthavyam dharyanj cha prayathathmana. 38<br/>
			<br/>
			This removes all committed sins,<br/>
			Is one with the four great Vedas,<br/>
			Could be understood by great effort,<br/>
			And could be committed to memory through effort.<br/>
			<br/>
			Sarva bhoothathma bhoothasya harasyamitha thejasa,<br/>
			Ashtothara sahasram thu naamnam sarvasya may srunu,<br/>
			Yacchuthwa manuja vyagra sarvaan kaamaanvapsyathi. 39<br/>
			<br/>
			Hey tiger among men, be pleased to hear from me,<br/>
			Those one thousand eight names of Him,<br/>
			Who is the soul of all souls,<br/>
			Who has greatly remarkable prowess,<br/>
			And who is called “hara(stealer)” and Sarva(all)”,<br/>
			Because he attracts every thing to himself,<br/>
			And attain fruition of all your desires.<br/>

			Yanna Brahmadayo deva vidhusthathwena narshaya 1<br/>
			<br/>
			I have praised with utmost devotion,<br/>
			That God who is not known ,<br/>
			Even to Gods like Brahma and sages.<br/>
			<br/>
			Sthothavya marchyam vandhyam cha ka sthoshyanthi jagath pathim,<br/>
			Bhakthim thwevam puraskruthya maya yagna pathir vibhu,<br/>

			<br/>
			Who is capable of Worshipping Him,<br/>
			Who is fit to be praised, worshipped and saluted?<br/>
			I who has been blessed by him due to my devotion,<br/>
			Can worship him who is the lord of Yagnas,<br/>
			And the foremost among those who are intelligent.<br/>
			<br/>
			Shivamebhi sthuvan devam naamabhi pushti vardhanai,<br/>
			Nithya yuktha suchir bhaktha prapnothyathmanamathmana. 3<br/>
			<br/>
			He who worships the lord with devotion,<br/>
			Using these names of Shiva the Lord ,<br/>
			With concentrated mind and devotion,<br/>
			Would automatically attain salvation.<br/>
			<br/>
			Rushayasch sthuvanthyethena thath param,<br/>
			Sthooyamano Maha deva , sthusyathe niyamathmabhi. 4<br/>
			<br/>
			The sages and Devas worship Him using these names,<br/>
			And the great Lord would be happy,<br/>
			If praised by these names with discipline.<br/>
			<br/>
			Bhakthanukampi Bhagawan aathmasamsthakaro vibhu,<br/>
			Thadaiva cha manushyeshu yea manushya pradanatha. 5<br/>
			<br/>
			Aasthikya sradha daanascha bahubhir janmabhi sthavai,<br/>
			Bhakthya hyananya meesaanaam param devam sanathanam. 6<br/>
			<br/>
			Karmana manasa vaacha bhavena mitha thejasa,<br/>
			Sayanaa jagramanascha vrajannu visamsthadha. 7<br/>
			<br/>
			Unmishna nimishan chaiva chinthayantha puna puna,<br/>
			Sruvantha sravayanthascha kadayanthascha they bhavam. 8<br/>
			<br/>
			Sthuvantha sthyumanascha thushyanthi cha ramanthi cha,<br/>

			<br/>
			Janthor vigatha paapasya bhave bhakthi prajayathe,<br/>
			Uthpanna cha bhave bhakthi rananya sarva havatha. 10<br/>
			<br/>
			Bhavina karena chasya sarva yukthascha sarvadha,<br/>
			Eetha dhyeveshu dushpraapam manushyeshu labhyathe. 11<br/>
			<br/>
			The god who is merciful on his devotees would establish them,<br/>
			And because of this, those best of men, those who believe in him,<br/>
			Those who concentrate on Him and nobody else,<br/>
			And those who worship him in several births,<br/>
			Who worship that God whose fame cannot be measured,<br/>
			And who is the greatest God known,<br/>
			By prayers , duties, mind and words ,<br/>
			While in dream and while they are awake,<br/>
			While they go out and while they enter in,<br/>
			While they open their eyes and while they close it,<br/>
			Think of him, hear of him and make others hear of Him,<br/>
			And praise him and be praised because of that,<br/>
			Would attain happiness and satisfaction in life.<br/>
			Those of who were born thousands of times,<br/>
			In different differing wombs and burn their sins in life,<br/>
			Would develop this type of devotion to Him,<br/>
			Which consists of depending only on him,<br/>
			Is not found among devas but only seen in rare men.<br/>
			<br/>
			Nirvigna Nischala Rudre bhakthi ravyabhicharini,<br/>

			Which is without any doubts ces in them,<br/>
			Only by the grace of Rudra and because of that,<br/>
			They who are prince among devotees attain him without doubt.<br/>
			<br/>
			Yea sarva bhavanugatha prapadhyanthe maheswaram,<br/>
			Prapanna vathsalo deva samasarathan samudhareth. 13<br/>
			<br/>
			Those who by all means follow and worship that Maheswara,<br/>
			Would be saved from the whirlpool of birth by him.<br/>
			<br/>
			Evamanye vikurvanthi deva samsara mochanam,<br/>
			Manushyanamruthe devam nana shakthisthapobalam. 14<br/>
			<br/>
			By this same path the devas also get rid of repeated births,<br/>
			And for men there is no need of strength and penance,<br/>
			Except this worship of the greatest of Gods.<br/>
			<br/>
			Ithi thenedra kalpena bhagan sadasath pathi,<br/>
			Kruthivasa sthutha Krishna Thandina Shubha budhina. 15<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh Lord Krishna, The sage Dandi,<br/>
			Who was as great as Indra,<br/>
			And who was of great intelligence,<br/>
			Praised by these words that God,<br/>
			Who covers himself with elephant hide,<br/>
			And who is the Lord of cause and effect.<br/>
			<br/>
			Sthvametham Bhgwatho Brahma swaya maadharyath,<br/>
			Geeyathe cha sa bhidhyetha Brahma Sankara sannidhou. 16<br/>
			<br/>
			Lord Brahma who heard this memorized this prayer,<br/>
			And when in front of Lord Shankara,<br/>
			The great Lord Brhama sings these with feeling.<br/>
			<br/>
			Idham punyam pavithram cha sarvadha papa nasanam,<br/>
			Yogadham Mokshadham chaiva Swaghadam Thoshadham Thadha. 17<br/>
			<br/>
			This prayer always gives rise to holy acts,<br/>
			Makes one clean, drives away sins,<br/>
			Grants yoga and thus salvation,<br/>
			And also takes one to heaven.<br/>
			<br/>
			Evamethad patanthe ya ekabhakthya thu sankaram,<br/>
			Yaa gathio sankhya yogaanaam brajanyethaa gathim thada. 18<br/>
			<br/>
			He who recites with devotion and concentration,<br/>
			Would eventually attain that status,<br/>
			Which is attained by adepts of Sankhya yoga.<br/>
			<br/>
			Sthavamedham prayathnena sada Rudrasya sannidhou ,<br/>
			Abdhamekam chared bhaktha Prapunuyath deepsidham Bhalam. 19<br/>
			<br/>
			He who with great effort recites this always,<br/>
			For a year in front of Lord Rudra,<br/>
			Would attain whatever he wants.<br/>
			<br/>
			Ethad rahasyam paramam Brahmano hrudhi samsthidham,<br/>
			Brahma provacha sakraya sacra provachamruthyuve. 20<br/>
			<br/>
			This very secret prayer , which is,<br/>
			Always kept in the heart of Brahma,<br/>
			Was taught by him to Indra,<br/>
			And Indra taught this to Yama.<br/>
			<br/>
			Mruthyu provacha Rudrebhyo , Rudrebhya thandimagamath,<br/>
			Mahatha Thapsa prapthastha Thandina Brahma sadmani. 21<br/>
			<br/>
			Yama told them to the Rudras,<br/>
			And sage Thandi got it from them,<br/>
			In the court of Brahma,<br/>
			As a result of severe penance.<br/>
			<br/>
			Thandi provacha Shukraya , Gowthamaya cha Bhargava,<br/>
			Vaivaswathya manave Gowthama praha Maadhava. 22<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh Madhava, Sage Thandi taught it to Shukra,<br/>
			Shukra taught it to sage Gowthama,<br/>
			And Gowthama taught it to Vaiwaswatha Manu.<br/>
			<br/>
			Narayanaya sadhyaya samadishtauya dheemathe,<br/>
			Yamaya praha Bhagwan saadhyo Narayono achyutha. 23<br/>
			<br/>
			He taught it to Sage Sathya Narayana ,<br/>
			Who was in Samadhi and greatly intelligent.<br/>
			This sage Sathyanarayana taught it to Yama<br/>
			<br/>
			(This Yama is not God of death)<br/>
			<br/>
			NachikethayaBhagawan aha Vaiwaswatho yama,<br/>
			Markandeyaya Vaarshneya Nachi ketho aabhya bhashatha. 24<br/>
			<br/>
			Oh Lord Krishna of the clan of Vrushni,<br/>
			This Yama who was the son of Viwaswan,<br/>
			Taught it to Sage Nachikethas,<br/>
			Who taught it to Markandeya.<br/>
			<br/>
			Markandeyan maya praptho niyamena Janardhana,<br/>
			Thavapyaha mamaithragna sthavam dadhyam hyavishrutham. 25<br/>
			<br/>
			Hey Lord Janadhana, I got it from Markandeya,<br/>
			And Hey killer of your enemies,<br/>
			I am giving this secret prayer to you.<br/>
			<br/>
			(Sage Upamanyu was teaching this to Lord Krishna)<br/>
			<br/>
			Swargya marogya mayushyam dhanyam Vedena sammitham,<br/>
			Naasya Vignam vikurvanthi dhanava yaksha rakshasa,<br/>
			Pisacha yathu dhana vaa guhyaka bhujaga api. 26<br/>
			<br/>
			This prayer which is equivalent to Vedas,<br/>
			Grants heaven , health, long life and wealth,<br/>
			And those who recite it cannot be troubled,<br/>
			By asuras, yakshas, rakshasas, ghosts, <br/>
			Yadu dhanas, Guhyakas and Nagas.<br/>
			<br/>
			Ya padeth suchi , Partha brahmachari jithendriya,<br/>
			Abhagna yogo varsha thu sosramaswa medha phalam labeth. 27<br/>
			<br/>
			Hey Yudishtra, To the one who recites this,<br/>
			Clean with continence and with control over senses,<br/>
			For a year without break,<br/>
			Would get the effect of performing the horse sacrifice.<br/>
			<br/>
			Jaigheeshavya Uvacha:-<br/>
			Mama ashta gunamaiswaryam datham Bhagwatha pura,<br/>
			Yathenaanyena bhalina Varanasyamm Yudishtra, 28<br/>
			<br/>
			Varanasyam Yudishtra  na ithi<br/>
			<br/>
			Jaigheeshavya told:-<br/>
			Hey Yudishtra, In olden times God gave me,<br/>
			Wealth and eight good qualities in Varanasi,<br/>
			As a result of my worship to him with sincerity and effort.<br/>
			<br/>
			 “In Varanasi, Yudishtra,”<br/>
			(The eight good qualities are mercy, patience, and absence of jealousy,
			Cleanliness, absence of tiredness, optimism, liberal nature and detachment)<br/>
			<br/>
			Garga Uvacha:-<br/>
			Chathu shashtyanga madadad kala gnanam mamadbutham,<br/>
			Sarswasthya thate thushto mano yagnena Pandava. 29<br/>
			Mano Yagnena Pandava  nama ithi (shows that text has not ended)<br/>
			<br/>
			Sage Garga told:-<br/>
			Hey son of Pandu, pleased by my mental prayer,<br/>
			That God gave me mastery in the sixty four arts.<br/>
			<br/>
			Son of Pandu, my mental prayer  Nama ithi<br/>
			<br/>
			Vaisampayana Uvacha:-<br/>
			Thatha Krishnobravid vakyam punar mathi mathaam vara,<br/>
			Yudishtram dharma nidhim puruhoothameeswara.<br/>
			Upamanyur mayi praha thapanniva diwakara. 30<br/>
			<br/>
			Vaisampayana told:<br/>
			The most intelligent Krishna <br/>
			Who is the ruler of every one,<br/>
			Told as follows Yudishtra ,<br/>
			Who is the storehouse of just actions, <br/>
			And one equivalent to Indra that,<br/>
			“Upamanyu shining as Sun God,<br/>
			Taught all these things to me.”<br/>
			<br/>
			Asubhai papa karmano yea nara kalushi krutha,<br/>
			Ishanam na prapadyanthe thamoraja savruthaya,<br/>
			Easwaram samprapadyanthe dwija bhavitha bhjavana. 31<br/>
			<br/>
			Those base humans who do sinful actions,<br/>
			And have been made baser by ill advised actions,<br/>
			Who have more of thamo and rajo guna,<br/>
			Do not engage themselves in worship of God,<br/>
			But those twice born who have good actions ,<br/>
			And thoughts worship him.<br/>
			<br/>
			Evameva Mahadeva bhaktha manava yea bhuvi,<br/>
			Na they samsara vasaga Ithi may nischitha mathi. 32<br/>
			Ithi may nischitha mathi  nama ithi<br/>
			<br/>
			I am firmly of the opinion that,<br/>
			Those devotees of the great God,<br/>
			Will never again suffer this birth and death.<br/>
			<br/>
			I am of the firm opinion  nama Ithi<br/>
			<br/>
			Ithi Sri Maha Bharathe satha sahasrikayam samhithayam,<br/>
			Vaiasikthyam Anusasana parvani,<br/>
			Ashta dasodhyaya<br/>
			<br/>
			Thus ends the eighteent chapter of the Anusasanika Parva<br/>
			Of the great Maha Baratha which has ten million stanzas.<br/>
			<br/>
			Duswapna Dushakuna Durgathi daurmanasya,<br/>
			Durbiksha durvyasana dusaha duryasamsi,<br/>
			Uthpatha thapa Visha beethi masad grahathim,<br/>
			Vyadhimscha nasayathu they Jagatham adheesa.<br/>
			Ithi Shiva sahasra namam sampoornam.<br/>
			<br/>
			Bad dreams, bad ens, bad results, bad mind,<br/>
			Famine, sad happenings, bad name which cannot be tolerated,<br/>
			Pain out of dangers, fear towards poison, Bad happenings due to planets,<br/>
			And diseases may please never enter my life, Oh God of the universe.<br/>
			Thus ends the thousand names of Shiva. </p>
