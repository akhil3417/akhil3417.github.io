  <summary>Description</summary>
<p>Chandrashekhara ashtakam is a divine hymn to praise God Shiva as
Chandrasekhara, the lord who is adorned with moon on his head (Chandra –
moon, Sekhar – crown) . The Chandrashekhara Ashtakam is a great remedy
for protection from difficulties including untimely death due to
accidents etc.</p>
<p>The lyrics and meaning of Chandrasekhara Ashtakam have an in-depth
explanation of the greatness of God shiva, his appearance, the
protection offered to his devotees, along with the divine qualities of
the Lord.</p>
<p>It was the hymn sung by Markandeya rishi and is related to his legend
where he offered his prayers to God Shiva, in order to get away from the
clutches of the Yama, the lord of death. During which, God Shiva offered
his protection to Markandeya, defeating Yama to the point of death.</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar Ashtakam was written by Rishi Markandeya. One legend
relates the story of how Lord Shiva protected Markandeya from the
clutches of death, personified as Lord Yama.</p>
<p>Mrikandu rishi and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought
from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result, he was given the
choice of either a righteous son, but with a short life on earth or 100
long-lived, foolish sons. Mrikandu rishi chose the former and was
blessed with Markandeya, an exemplary son, destined to die at the age of
16.</p>
<p>Markandeya grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of
his destined death, he continued his worship of Shiva in his aniconic
form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the god of death were
unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual
worship of Shiva. Yama then came in person to take away Markandeya’s
life and sprung his noose around the young sage’s neck. By accident or
fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, and out of it,
Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression.
After defeating Yama in a battle to the point of death, Shiva then
revived him, under the condition that the devout youth would live
forever. For this act, Shiva was thereafter also known as Kalantaka
(“Ender of Death”).</p>
<p>The word Kalantaka means “He who ends Death”. The name is derived
from two Sanskrit words- kala (काल) which means “Death or Time” and
antaka (अन्तक) which means “He who ends”.</p>
<p>Sage Markandeya sang the Chandrasekhar Ashtakam in praise of Lord
Shiva. Every single word in the song is absolutely profound and
beautiful.</p>
