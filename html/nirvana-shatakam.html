<p><strong>Commentary and Notes Translated by S. N. Sastr
Introduction:</strong> Sri Sankara *Bhagavatpada has blessed posterity
with a large number of invaluable *compositions. These can be grouped
under three broad categories. The first *category, meant for the
intellectually most advanced, comprises his commentaries *(Bhashya) on
the Upanishads, Brahmasutra, and the Bhagavadgita. The second *category
consists of independent works, known as prakarana granthas, which
*expound the gist of the Upanishads in simple language. These vary in
length from *half a verse to one thousand verses. In the third category
fall devotional hymn</p>
<p>Nirvana Shatakam also known as Atma Shatakam is a prakarana grantha
consisting of six verses. Prakarana has been defined in the Vishnu
Dharmottara Purana thus: “Prakarana is a text which explains some
particular aspects of the Sastra and deals with certain secondary
questions arising out of the explanations given”.</p>
<p>The instruction emphatically conveyed by the six verses of Nirvana
Shatakam is that identification with the body, mind, and senses is the
root cause of all sorrow and that it should be given up and one should
realize one's real nature as none other than the supreme Brahman. This
realization is what is known as Liberation. One by one, Adi
Shankaracharya negates all the usual identifications that we have and
repeatedly insists, “chidananda roopa shivoham shivoham.”</p>
<p><strong>Verse 1</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I am not the mind, nor the intellect, nor the ego-sense, nor the
store-house of memories. I am not the ear, nor the tongue, nor the nose,
nor the eyes. Nor am I the sky (space), or the earth, or fire, or air. I
am the supreme auspiciousness of the nature of consciousness-bliss. I am
(Shiva) the auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: In all these verses the term ‘I' stands for the pure
Atma. The mind is defined thus in Brihadaranyaka upanishad, 1.5.3 –
“Desire, resolve, doubt, faith, lack of faith, steadiness, unsteadiness,
shyness, intelligence, fear – all these are nothing but the mind”. The
idea brought out here is that all emotions are in the mind and not in
the Atma. A person identifies himself with his mind when he says, “I
desire this”, “I have resolved to do this”, etc. This verse points out
that this identification is wrong and is due to ignorance of the fact
that everyone is in reality the Atma or self, which is identical with
the supreme Brahman. The question arises, why have the intellect,
ego-sense and the chittam been mentioned separately, when they are all
included in the mind itself? The reason is that, though the mind is only
one, it is given four different names in Vedanta according to the four
different functions performed by it. This has been explained by Sri
Sankara in Vivekachudamani in slokas 95 and 96 as below:</p>
<p>“The one antahkarana or inner organ is known by four different names,
manas, buddhi, ahankara and chittam according to the different
functions. When the mind cogitates it is called manas. When it comes to
a decision it is called buddhi. When it stores memories, it is called
chittam. When it identifies itself with each of these functions it is
known as ahankara. The manner in which these functions take place can be
explained by taking an illustration. I am walking along the road and I
see at a distance a person whose gait seems to resemble that of a
certain friend of mine, named Raman. I begin to debate whether the
person I see at a distance is Raman or not. This function of debating is
what is called ‘manas'. When he comes nearer and I am able to see his
face clearly, I compare it with the memory of the face of Raman stored
in my mind. This memory is ‘chittam'. If I find that the two tally, I
decide that he is Raman and I greet him. This function of deciding is
called ‘buddhi'. The performer of all these three functions is ‘I',
which is known as ‘ahankara'. The term ‘manas' is also generally used to
denote all these four collectively, when these distinctions are not
intended.</p>
<p>By the statement “I am not the mind, etc.”, we are asked not to
identify ourselves with these activities of the mind and to look upon
ourselves as the pure Atma which is actionless and is a mere witness of
the activities of the mind. In this way we will not be affected by the
joys and sorrows that arise in the mind. In the Bhagavad Gita, 3.27, the
Lord says that all actions are performed by the body, mind and senses,
but because of delusion everyone thinks that he is the doer.</p>
<p>A person identifies himself with his body and his sense organs when
he says, “I am stout, I am fair-complexioned, I hear, I taste, I smell,
I see, etc”. The second line points out that this identification is also
wrong and is due to delusion. The body is made up of the five elements,
space, air, fire, water, and earth. By denying identification with these
in the third line, identification with the physical body is denied.</p>
<p>The last line says that we are none other than the supreme Brahman
which is existence-consciousness-bliss. The word Siva should not be
mistaken to mean Lord Siva. Those who want to attack Advaita interpret
this as meaning that Advaita asks the individual to arrogate to himself
the status of God Himself. This is a wrong understanding. The term
‘Siva' is used here in the same sense as in the Mandukya Upanishad, 7,
where it means ‘auspiciousness' and denotes the supreme Brahman. The
identity declared by Advaita is not between the individual or jiva as
such and God. What Advaita says is that the jiva, as well as God, are in
reality none but the pure Brahman, with the vesture of the body, mind,
and senses in the case of the jiva and Maya in the case of God. These
vestures are not real. When these unreal vestures are negated, what
remains in both cases is only the pure Brahman.</p>
<p>The body and mind have only empirical reality, i.e. they appear to be
real only until the dawn of self-knowledge. Atma, which is identical
with Brahman, is alone the absolute reality which is eternal and
changeless. Thus, the very essence of Advaita Vedanta, namely, the
identity of the jivAtma and paramAtma is brought out in this verse and
in all the subsequent verses.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I am not what is known as the life-breath, nor am I the five vital
airs. I am not the seven ‘dhatus' or constituents of the body. I am not
the five sheaths. I am not speech, nor the hands, nor the feet. I am not
the genital organ, nor the organ of excretion. I am the supreme
auspiciousness of the nature of consciousness-bliss. I am (Shiva) the
auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: The praana or life breath is given five names in Vedanta
according to the five functions performed by it. These are what are
spoken of as the five vital airs in this sloka. The five vital airs are
praana, vyaana, apaana, samaana, and udaana. These are described in Sri
Sankara's Bhashya on Prasnopanishad. 3.5, thus: He (praana) places
apaana, a division of himself, in the two lower apertures, as engaged in
the work of ejecting the excreta. Praana himself, who occupies the
position of the sovereign, resides in the eyes and the ears and issues
out through the mouth and nostrils. In the navel is samaana, which is so
called because it assimilates all that is eaten or drunk, distributes
them equally in all parts of the body and effects digestion. Udaana,
another division of praana, moves throughout the body and functions
upwards. It leads the soul out of the body at the time of death and
takes it to other worlds according to one's punya and paapa. Vyaana
regulates praana and apaana and is the cause of actions requiring
strength. All these are only air and are therefore insentient.
Kathopanishad, 2.2.5 says, “Mortals do not live by praana or apaana, but
by something else on which these two depend”. They depend on the Atma
which is what gives them sentiency. Here we are told not to identify
ourselves with the life-breath.</p>
<p>The seven dhatus are the constituents of the body such as marrow,
fat, flesh, blood, lymph, skin, and the cuticle.</p>
<p>The five sheaths: These are described in the Taittiriya Upanishad.
The physical body is the outermost sheath. It is called the
annamayakosha or sheath of food because it is nourished by food. Within
this is the praanamayakosha or sheath of vital air, which is made up of
the vital air with its five divisions and the organs of action, namely,
speech, hands, feet, the genitals, and the organ of excretion. The next
inner sheath is the manomayakosha or sheath of the mind, which is made
up of the mind and the five organs of perception, namely, ear, eye, and
the senses of smell. taste, and touch. The next sheath is
vijnaanamayakosha or the sheath of the intellect. This consists of the
intellect or buddhi and the five organs of perception. The innermost
sheath is the anandamayakosha or sheath of bliss. This is the primal
ignorance or avidya which is the cause of transmigratory existence.
These five sheaths constitute the body-mind complex. The instruction is
that we should not identify ourselves with these which are all ephemeral
and always undergoing changes.</p>
<p>The third line says that we are not the five organs of action. The
last line is the same as in the first sloka.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 3</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I do not have any aversion or attachment, nor do I have greed,
delusion, pride, or jealousy. I do not hanker after Dharma, wealth,
pleasures, or liberation (the four purushaarthas). I am the supreme
auspiciousness of the nature of consciousness-bliss. I am (Shiva) the
auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: All the emotions such as likes, dislikes, greed, etc.,
belong to the mind and so the Atma has no connection with them. The
rules of Dharma apply only when there is identification with the
body-mind complex. The Atma has no desire for wealth or pleasures. The
Atma is ever liberated. It is only when the Atma is identified with the
body-mind complex that there is the notion of bondage and it is only
then that liberation has to be sought. The pure Atma is ever free. A
person who has become totally free from identification with his body and
mind is already liberated. As far as the Atma itself is concerned, it
has neither bondage nor liberation, just as there is neither day nor
night in the sun itself.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 4</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There is no such thing as merit or sin for me. Nor is there joy or
sorrow. I have no need for mantras, or pilgrimage, or Vedas, or
sacrifices. I am neither the enjoyed nor the enjoyer, nor enjoyment.I am
the supreme auspiciousness of the nature of consciousness-bliss. I am
(Shiva) the auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: All these are only for the jiva who identifies himself
with his body and mind. The Atma is pure, untainted, and actionless.
Once a person has realized that he is the pure Atma, he has no need of
mantras, pilgrimage, etc., because there is nothing more to be attained.
The joy and sorrow referred to in this sloka are those which arise due
to external circumstances. These have a beginning and an end and these
pertain only to the mind and not the Atma. The Atma is of the very
nature of supreme eternal bliss.</p>
<p>I am neither the enjoyed nor the enjoyer, nor enjoyment – What is
enjoyed is an object. So this means that the Atma is not an object. The
enjoyer is one who performs an action, a doer. So this means that the
Atma is not a doer. Enjoyment is an act. Atma is not an act.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 5</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I have no possibility of death, nor distinction of caste. I have no
father, nor mother. I have no birth. I have no relations, nor friend,
nor guru, nor disciple. I am the supreme auspiciousness of the nature of
consciousness-bliss. I am (Shiva) the auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: All relationships exist only as long as a person looks
upon himself as the body-mind complex. The Atma is eternal and so it has
no birth and no death.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 6</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I am unconditioned (and so free from all attributes). I am formless.
I am all-pervading. I am beyond the organs. I am ever the same. There is
neither bondage nor liberation for me. I am the supreme auspiciousness
of the nature of consciousness-bliss. I am (Shiva) the
auspiciousness</li>
</ol>
<p>Commentary: The pure Atma is not conditioned or limited by the body
and mind. The Atma, being identical with Brahman, is all-pervading and
changeless. Bondage is nothing but identification with the body and
mind. This is due to ignorance of our real nature. When this ignorance
is destroyed by the knowledge of our real nature it will be realized
that there never was any bondage at all. It is not as if everyone is in
bondage and becomes liberated on attaining self-knowledge. Everyone is
in reality none other than the supreme Brahman even before the dawn of
self-knowledge. Liberation is not the production of a new state that did
not exist earlier. Liberation is only the realization that one has
always been Brahman but has been wrongly thinking of himself as a
limited being. This can be understood by taking the classic example of
the rope being mistaken for a snake. In the presence of light when it is
found that there is only a rope, no one will say that there was
previously a snake, but now there is only a rope. Similarly, it is wrong
to say that there was previously bondage and after the dawn of knowledge
there is liberation. In reality, there is neither bondage nor
liberation, but both are attributed to the jiva due to ignorance.</p>
