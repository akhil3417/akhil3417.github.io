	<p>

This is a verse from Manasollasa (Section 1, Verse 30), an extensive commentary
on Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram, written by Sri Sureshvaracharya, a disciple of
Sri Adi Sankaracharya (who composed Sri Dakshinamurti Stotram). Sri
Dakshinamurthy is not only worshiped as the first Guru, but also as the One, who
teaches everyone through the medium of innumerable number of human Gurus.
	</p>
<br>
The Lord himself is in this three-fold form as Iśvara, Guru and atman, the Self.<br>
<br>
Mürti-bheda-vibhāgine, the one who remains ‘as though’ divided in this<br>
three-fold form. Like what?<br>
<p>

Vyomavad vyāpta-dehāya Vyomavat, like space. Like the space inside your stomach,
the space inside the room and the space outside pervades everything, so too, the
reality of Brahman pervades the Lord, Isvara, the Guru, and the individual, the
jīva. Salutations unto the one whose form, deha, is all-pervasive like space,
and who is nothing other than the saccidānanda Brahman.

 A prayer asking the Lord (Shiva) for total forgiveness. A prayer to God Shiva
 asking him to forgive all our mistakes, which are committed by our various
 organs of action and speech, and bless us with his mercy. Lord Shiva is known
 as the lord of mercy and compassion. This is a great prayer to say with full
 earnestness at the end of each day, just before going to sleep. A detailed
 explanation follows:
  </p>

  <br>
करचरण कृतं – done with hand(s) and leg(s);<br>
वाक् कायजम् – born of speech and the body;<br>
कर्मजम् – born of actions; वा – or;<br>
श्रवणनयनजं – born of ears and eyes; वा – or;<br>
मानसम् (born of) the mind; वा – or;<br>
अपराधम् – errors (sins);<br>
विहितम् – ordained;<br>
अविहितम् – prohibited; वा – or;<br>
सर्वम् – all; एतत् – this;<br>
क्षमस्व – do forgive;<br>
जय जय – victory to Thee;<br>
करुणाब्धे – O Compassionate One;<br>
श्री महादेव – O Mahadeva; शम्भो – O Sambhu.<br>
<br>
<p>

To err is human, to forgive divine. We tend to err and commit mistakes knowingly
or unknowingly ever so often. We should be alert enough to realize our mistakes,
regret doing the same (paścāttāpa), seek forgiveness (kṣamā yācanā), resolve
never to repeat them, and do our best to compensate for the same by expiatory
action (prāyaścitta). Now, how do we commit sins?
</p>
<p>

Mistakes or sins committed with our limbs: kara-carana kṛtam: Hands do wrong
when they serve the unrighteous ones, when they steal, aggrandize and hurt
others, and do not worship God or serve His devotees or give in charity. To go
where we should not (places of vices and seeking the company of the unholy) and
not to go where we should (satsanga – sacred places and holy company) is to sin
with the legs.
</p>
<p>

Mistakes or sins born of speech, body and actions: vāk-kāyajam-karmajam: The
speech does wrong when we criticize others or gossip, utter untruths and harsh
words and not sing His glories. To worship only the body (deha pūjā) and not the
Lord (deva pūjā), to do evil actions and not to work for self-improvement is to
sin through the body and by our actions.
</p>
<p>

Mistakes and sins born of ears and eyes: śravaṇa-nayanajam: We do wrong through
our ears, when we listen to gossip, when we ignore good advice, and do not
listen to the glories of God. To see and appreciate only the inauspicious and
not His glories is to sin with the eyes.
</p>
<p>

(Born of) the mind: mānasam: To think evil, plot devious acts, and never
meditate on God or enquire about the Truth is to sin mentally.
</p>
<p>

Ordained or prohibited: vihitam-avihitam: We do wrong when we partially follow
the ordained or do what is prohibited.
</p>
<p>

    Here the devotee asks for a blanket (complete) forgiveness that covers all his
    sins and mistakes. Such forgiveness is possible only by God or by Divine Souls.
    It is only His compassion and His inherent divine nature that makes the Lord
    forgive us each time. Who would not worship such a great and compassionate Lord?
    May He always be victorious. Indeed, He alone is always victorious!! May He
    shower His blessings on us always.

  <p>

Karpur Gauram Karunavtaaram is a very powerful and popular mantra chanted
especially during Aarati (or Mangala Arati) to the Lord. It is an ancient
Sanskrit Shloka related to Lord Shiva and is also known as Shiva Yajur Mantra.
Karpur Gauram Karunavtaaram mantra is found in Yajurveda, one of the four Vedas.
  </p>
  <p>

The word Shiva signifies the auspicious. Lord Shiva roots out sin and terror and
is the bestower of earthly happiness, promoter of good, and auspiciousness.
Shiva is also called Sankara which means doer of good. Shiva takes one beyond
the three bodies (Tripura), gross, subtle, and causal that envelope the Jeeva or
the embodied soul. He is hence the Hara or the remover of all evil and the idol
of renunciation.
  </p>
  <p>

This mantra is considered among the most powerful mantras of protection, it
protects us from negativity, dangers and enemies. Chanting Shiva’s mantra
regularly changes our vibrations and energies both within our body and outside
and brings us success and prosperity in all areas of our life.
  </p>

karpūragauram – Lord Shiva who is pure as camphor.<br><br>
karuṇāvatāram – The person whose personality is the embodiment of compassion and who is the incarnation of compassion.<br><br>
sansārsāram – That which is the essence of the whole creation.<br><br>
bhujagendrahāram – The one with the serpent king as his garland.<br><br>
sadāvasantam hrdayāravinde – Hridaya aravinde means ‘in heart’ (pure in form of lotus). The Lotus even though is born in water, its leaf is completely unaffected by water (drops) that are on it and remains pure. In the same way Lord Shiva always lives in the heart of all beings, as the pure witness, pure consciousness, unaffected by their actions.<br><br>
bhavam – To Lord Shiva<br><br>
bhavānī sahitam – Together with Bhavani (Shakti)<br><br>
namāmi – I bow to (I bow to Shiva and Shakti together)<br><br>

  <summary><strong>Commentary</strong></summary>
  <p>

This is a popular verse from Sri Dakshinamurti Stotram, composed by Sri Adi
Sankaracharya.
  </p>

 <br>
  <strong>Meaning of Dakshinamurti</strong>
  <br>
  <p>

Amürtih is the one who is formless and who is the truth of everything. With
maya-sakti Isvara is daksinah, the one who has the capacity to be the creator
and sustainer, and also the one who can take back the whole creation into
himself. Therefore, Isvara who is daksina as well as amürti is Dakshinamürti.
  </p>
  <p>

Daksina also means the southern direction. He is the Lord who is facing the
south, daksinn-dik-abhi-mukha murtih. What is the significance of the southern
direction? The north attracts, and it stands for moksha. The south stands for
samsara; it is Lord Yama’s place. The Lord is everywhere, but the one who wants
release from samsara faces the Lord in the north. The Lord has to face you to
teach. As the source of all-knowledge, he faces the south. Salutations unto Lord
Dakshinamürti who is the source of all-knowledge and the source of all blessing.
  </p>

Meaning of this Sloka
  <br>
  <p>

Mudita-vadanam means the one who has a smiling face. The teacher cannot look very serious when he is teaching that you are ananda. He is sitting there under this tree with a smile.
  </p>
  <p>

Svātmārāmam, the one who is reveling in himself, who is anandarūpam, in the form of ananda. Ananda is not necessarily laughing; there can be quiet, smiling ananda too.
  </p>
  <p>

Karakalita-cinmudram, whose hand is held in the gesture of wisdom, cinmudra.
  </p>
  <p>

Varṣiṣṭhāntevasad-ṛṣigaṇairāvṛtam, surrounded by a group of elderly sages, (Sanaka, and others), who are brahmaniṣṭhas, committed to the knowledge of Brahman.
  </p>
  <p>

Acaryendram, the initiator of all the teaching is the Lord, Indra, of the teachers. They say Śrī Dakshiṇāmūrti taught in silence. If you are the sanakadi-jīvas, then, perhaps, silence is enough. If silence were the teaching, then these upanişads will have empty pages instead of text. The teaching is in the form of words.
  </p>
  <p>

Mauna-vyākhyā- prakaṭita means what is taught is the intended meaning of the words, sabda-lakṣya, and not the immediate meaning, śabda-vacya. The teaching negates wrong notions you have about yourself. When the negation is complete, you remain as the very lakṣya, the target, the meaning that the words want to convey. The teaching is such that you recognise yourself, dropping all your wrong notions. That is what they call mauna, silence.
  </p>
  <p>

Yuvānam, here, means timeless, nitya-yuvā, the one who is not subject to time. He is always young. He faces the south and the students face the north. This is one meaning of Dakṣiṇāmūrti. Another is the one who has all the capacity, dakṣinaḥ, and is formless, amūrtiḥ, dakṣiṇaścāsau amurtiḥ. He is dakṣiṇaḥ, the one who has capacity to be both the maker and the material cause. He is the creator, the sustainer and the one who takes everything back into himself. The idea here is that the Lord is both the manifest and unmanifest jagat, dakṣiṇaḥ. But in truth he is without form, svayam amūrtiḥ. Therefore, the jagat is the Lord whose essential form is free from jagat. That is what he teaches.

Siva Prarthana – A shlokam in praise of Lord Shiva.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Significance of the shlokam Namaste Astu – Excerpt from ‘Prayer Guide’ by Swami Dayananda<br>
  </p>
  <p>

This is a beautiful mantra. It is very good,especially for prayascitta, and can be chanted when one feels guilty for one’s omissions and commissions.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Namaḥ, namaskār. Te, to you, astu, be. Bhagavan, Oh Lord! My namaskār unto you Oh Lord!<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Namaḥ astu viśveśvarāya. You have to repeat namaḥ astu with each name. Viśveśvarāya. Isvara, the Lord of the entire viśva, the entire jagat, the world. My namaskar unto the Lord of the entire world.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Mahādevāya, unto the one who is mahān, limitless, and a deva, effulgent.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Tryambakaya, unto the one who has three eyes. He knows the past, the present, and the future. He is all-knowing.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Tripurantakaya, unto the one who is antaka, the one who brings an end of Tripura, the three puras, cities or worlds, bhuḥ, bhuvaḥ and suvaḥ. Tripurantakāya is the one who takes all the three worlds unto himself.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Trikālāgni-kālāya, unto the one who devours the three kālas, or time, which consists of the past, present and future. Kāla eva agniḥ kālāgniḥ. Agni means fire. Kālagni, time, is such that, like fire, it distorts and devours everything, and the Lord devours time itself. In other words, he is timeless, being the creator, the sustainer, and the destroyer of time.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Kalagnirudraya. He is the kāla-agni-rūpena rudraḥ, the one who in the form of the kāla-agni, time, makes everybody weep, or in other words, he is the chastiser, the giver of the fruits of action, karmaphaladātā.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Nilakaṇṭhāya, unto the one who is all-pervasive and manifest in the form of the jagat, whose kantha or neck is the blue sky. This is a beautiful vision of the whole jagat as a manifestation of Isvara, with the blue sky being Bhagavān’s neck.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Mṛtyunjayaya, unto the overlord of mṛtyu, death. The Lord of Death thought that he was the greatest, until he was made to realize that Isvara was supreme. There are many interesting stories about this. The story of Mārkandeya is based upon this aspect of Isvara .<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Sarvesvaraya, unto the Lord of all the worlds, bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ and suvaḥ. He is the Lord of all beings, including the various devatās, deities.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Sadaśivāya, unto the one who, despite being the Lord of everything, is himself untouched by anything. The entire jagat is his manifestation, sustained by him and absorbed back unto him, but who is he? He is Sadāśiva, of the nature of pure ānandā, the limitless Consciousness.<br>
  </p>
  <p>

Śrīmanmahadevāya namaḥ, my namaskār unto the one who is śriman mahadeva. Śriman is śrimat, which means śrimān, (pronounced Srimaan) one who is a blessing. In reciting this verse, we invoke the Lord in the form of śriman mahadeva and seek his blessing..<br>

Om (learn more about Om here) is an invocation to the Lord Pranavarthaya. Unto pranavartha, the meaning of pranava. Pranava is the name of Om, but we do not chant in japa, pranava, pranava… Pranava means always fresh or eternal which is om and artha is meaning. So pranavartha is the meaning of Om. The meaning of Om is Bhagavan, the Lord, and is derived from the root av, which means ‘to protect’- avati rakshati iti om. Om is the one who protects and sustains the entire creation.

Namah, my salutations, to the Lord, Bhagavan, the one who has bhaga, the six-fold glories: aisvarya, overlordship; Sri, wealth and health; virya, strength; yasas, fame; jnana, knowledge, and vairagya, freedom from a sense of want. The word Bhagavan, by which I invoke the Lord, is everything that I seek. Not only do I seek moksa, knowledge, I also seek blessings for achieving whatever I need to achieve in life. Therefore, in relating to the Lord as Bhagavan, I am invoking the grace of Bhagavan.

Amürtih is the one who is formless and who is the truth of everything. With maya-sakti Isvara is daksinah, the one who has the capacity to be the creator and sustainer, and also the one who can take back the whole creation into himself. Therefore, Isvara who is daksina as well as amürti is Daksinamürti.

  <p>

Daksina also means the southern direction. He is the Lord who is facing the south, daksinn-dik-abhi-mukha murtih. What is the significance of the southern direction? The north attracts, and it stands for moksha. The south stands for samsara; it is Lord Yama’s place. The Lord is everywhere, but the one who wants release from samsara faces the Lord in the north. The Lord has to face you to teach. As the source of all-knowledge, he faces the south. Salutations unto Lord Daksinamürti who is the source of all-knowledge and the source of all blessing.
  </p>
  <p>

Mahyam, to me, prayaccha, give; what? Asking is important. Always ask for what do you want. Often we hear, “Do not ask Bhagavan. He knows everything. He knows what do you need.” Asking is part of prayers, as a karma. Bhagavan’s grace is always available, but you have to tap it. This grace is like ground water that has to be tapped by the act of prayer. Gaining anything in terms of worldly or spiritual life depends upon your making the right decisions. Life is a series of decisions. You are what you are because of your decisions. For making the right decisions you require two things, prajña, clarity of knowledge and medha, availability of memory. In understanding any topic, you require prajña. It means alertness, clarity of vision. No matter what the topic is, whether it is a moral issue, a legal issue, or an economic issue, to succeed you require prajna.
  </p>
  <p>

Medha, thinking power and memory has to be at service always. Memory is important. If medha and prajna are there, all success will come to you. That is why you pray, “Oh Lord please bless with me with medha and prajna.”
  </p>
  <p>

Svaha is a word used at the time of offering oblations unto fire for different devatas. Here the meaning would be, “This chanting is my offering to you.”

	  <strong> This mantra is called Rudra Gayatri Mantra.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>

Lord Rudra is a famous deity worshipped popularly in Hinduism since Vedic times. Rudra is the manifestation of Lord Shiva and quite often the term Shiva and Rudra are used interchangeably. Rudra is the destructive and cleansing force. Though the name looks fierce, Lord Rudra is highly merciful and benevolent in fulfilling the needs of the devotees.
  </p>
  <p>

Gayatri mantras are protective in nature. They act like a shield surrounding the individual and protect them from all fears and dangers. The Rudra or Shiva Gayatri mantra says “I meditate on the Supreme Being of Lord Maha Deva. Let Lord Rudra illumine my intellect and show a clear path to enlightenment.”
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Benefits of chanting Rudra mantras</strong>
  <p>

Rudra mantras remove fear and clear all the confusions and vagaries of the mind. Every human has a set of fears. Chanting Rudra mantra regularly in the prescribed manner with devotion and focus of mind can help overcome all kinds of fears and stresses.
  </p>
  <p>

Rudra mantra is the ultimate panacea for all illnesses, discomforts and diseases. It can relieve the individual of the uncomfortable state of illnesses and promote overall health and happiness.
  </p>
  <p>

When you feel your energies are drained, you can chant Rudra mantra to recharge your body, mind and spirit. Rudra mantra can relieve the harmful influences of planets and bring peace and stability into the individual’s life. It can augment the positive planetary influences and offset the negative impacts of some unfavourable planetary combinations.
  </p>

  <br>
  <strong>Detailed meaning from the book Prayer Guide by Swami Dayananda</strong>
  <p>

Rudra is the one who is known through the sāstras or Vedas. The word ‘Rudra’ means the one who destroys samsāra or ajñāna, ignorance. The other meaning is the one into whom the whole world is resolved. When the Lord absorbs into himself everything that is projected, he is Rudra. That is why you will see Lord Siva sitting in meditation. Everything is absorbed into him; the whole world of time and space collapses into him. The limitless conscious being, saccidānanda-vastu, who is Isvara as the one who brings into manifestation, sustains and resolves the world, srsti-sthiti-laya-kartr, is called Rudra, in the function of resolving. He is the one whose grace is invoked for the removal of ignorance. This Rudra is puruşa, who is pūrņa or limitless. What kind of puruşa is he?
  </p>
  <p>

	  <strong>Tatpuruṣāya, tasmai puruṣāya</strong> which is to be taken as <strong>tam puruşam</strong>. It is told in the śāstras that Isvara, is the <strong>prathama-puruşa</strong>, the first person. In English grammar what we call the third person is the first person in Sanskrit. He is the first one and everything comes from him. We pray to know that being, <strong>puruşa</strong>, who is<strong> pūrņa</strong>, limitless, and who is revealed by the sāstra. <strong>Puruṣāya is construed as puruşam</strong>, the accusative case.
  </p>
  <p>

Vidmahe, may we know or come to know. The verb is in the plural. This is a gayatri-mantra. In all gayatri mantras, like this one, the verb is in the plural. Why do we say ‘we’ when it is ‘I’ who wants to know? This is because we include others in our prayer. May we know that puruşa who is limitless.
  </p>
  <p>

	  <strong>Mahadevāya dhimahi</strong>. Dhimahi means we meditate upon. We meditate upon that Lord Mahadeva who is <strong>mahān</strong>, limitless, and who is all-knowledge, devā, the Lord of all Lords and the Lord of all devatās like Indra, Varuna and so on.
  </p>
  <p>

	  <strong>Tanno rudraḥ pracodayāt</strong>: Tat, that Rudra or Mahādeva, who we want to know and upon whom we meditate,<strong> naḥ pracodayāt</strong>, may he impel us. May he set our minds in the proper direction to enable us to discover what the truth is, and what the Lord is. Here one meaning of pracodayet is, may he impel the mind on the proper course of action. We can also understand it to mean <strong>pracodanam kuryāt</strong>. Pracodana means dyotana, illumination. May he endow our minds with lustre and clarity, may he make all our thoughts brilliant or effulgent!
  </p>
<p>In Hindu theology the birth of Tantra is described as such: In the beginning of Satyuga (the age of truth or sincerity), Lord Shiva appeared in the form of Panchanana-Shiva with 5 heads and 18 arms. By the Anugraha (grace) of Lord Shiva Himself as manifested in His 5 acts, and through His 5 energies, the 5 heads emanated from his 5 mouths the Tantras to illuminate the universe.

The Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, Nepal, is home to one of the 5-faced Shivas.</p>

<strong><h2>Tryambakam Yajamahe</h2></strong>

We worship Lord Shiva the three-eyed one, the one who is the master of all senses and qualities and the one who is the sustainer of all growth. May he release us from the bondage of death, just as a ripened cucumber is released from its stalk, and may he (not deprive us of immortality) grant us immortality.

  <summary><strong>Commentary</strong></summary>
  <p>

 The Mrityunjaya Mantra (‘Death-defeating mantra’) also known as the Rudra Mantra or Tryambakam Mantra, is a verse of the Rigveda (RV 7.59.12) addressed to Tryambaka, “The Three-eyed One”, an epithet of Rudra who is identified with Shiva. The verse also recurs in the Yajurveda. The mantra is beneficial for mental, emotional, and physical health and consider it a moksha mantra which bestows longevity and immortality. It is chanted while smearing vibhuti over various parts of the body and utilised in japa (mantra repetition) or homa (religious offering ceremony). This mantra is also from the Sri Rudram, which is a hymn on Lord Śiva.
  </p>
  <p>

This verse contains a beautiful metaphor. The urvāruka fruit is a melon which grows on the ground attached to a vine. It takes its time to ripen. When fully ripe, it does not have to be plucked. It detaches itself from effortlessly, remaining where it is, but free from the vine.
  </p>
  <p>

Amṛta is total freedom from the sense of all inadequacy and limitation. An essential requirement in gaining amṛta is emotional maturity, which is gained by the process of inner growth, by living a life of values and prayer. This maturing of the mind is likened to the ripening of the fruit.
  </p>
  <p>

There is another important aspect in this example. Freedom being the essential nature of the self, the mature mind does not have to seek outside itself to gain this freedom. When a mature mind is exposed to the teaching, it effortlessly comes to recognize that freedom. That is the gain of that which already has been gained. Thus, this is a prayer of mumukṣu, a person who has desires that total freedom and who makes it his main pursuit in life.
  </p>
<p>

    It is also a mantra which is traditionally chanted by family and friends for a person who is ill and approaching
    death. This prayer should be learned and recited using the three svaras, tones that are used in Vedic chanting.

    <h2>Vagarthaviva Sampruktau</h2>

<hr class="verse_separator_strong">

<div class="verse_sanskrit">

I worship Parvati and Parameshwara, the parents of the world, who are inseparable, just like a word and its sense, in order to guide me in acquiring the right understanding of words and their meanings.<br>
	</p>

Alternate meaning when Parvathi Paramaeshvarau is considered as Parvathipa Rameshvaru: Kalidasa is praying to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu who are ‘Pitharau’ (fathers) to this Jagath who are inseparable like the word and the meaning.<br>

  <summary><strong>Commentary</strong></summary>

  <p>

This is the opening sloka in divine poet Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsam, a sanskrit epic (Mahākāvya) consisting of 1,564 stanzas describing the lineage of kings of the Raghu dynasty (ancestors of Sri Rama). The literal interpretation of this Shloka is that it is a prayer by Kalidasa, addressed to deities Lord Shiva and Parvathi, seeking their blessings for proficieny in literature as he begins the epic Raghuvamsa. i.e. For the correct grasping of words and their sense I bow to Parvati and Parameshvara who are the parents of the universe and are inseperable like words and their meaning.
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>vāgarthāviva</strong> – This compound splits as ‘vaak arthau iva’ . vaak is ‘word’ and artha is ‘meaning’ in this context. The word iva means ‘like’. The meaning of the phrase would be ‘just like the word and its meaning’
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>samprukthau</strong> – sampruktha is ‘blended into one’ or ‘attached’ (to each other)
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>vaagartha</strong> – vaak and artha, the word and its meaning
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>prathipaththaye</strong> – means ‘in order to acquire’
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>jagatha</strong> – jagath is the world. The Lord (naatha, pathi) of jagath is Jagannaatha or Jagathpath.
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>pitharau</strong> – pitha is father. pitharau in this context would be parents
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>vandhe</strong> – to salute
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>paarvathi parameshvarau </strong>– Paarvathi is Goddess Uma and Parameshwara is Lord Shiva
  </p>
  <p>

To summarize, Kalidasa prays to the divine parents Paarvathi & Parameshwara who are inseparable like the word and its meaning, in order to guide him in acquiring the power of words and their meanings (literature) as he embarks on the Mahakavya, Raghuvamsa.
  </p>
  <p>

There is another interpretation at work here in terms of whom Kalidasa was actually praying to. If the final phrase is rearranged a bit, we get the below:
  </p>
  <p>

<strong>paarvathipa rameshvarau</strong>

  </p>
  <p>

Now pa: in Sanskrit can indicate ‘Lord of/Husband of’. Thus paarvathipa can mean Lord Shiva (Husband of Paarvathi). Rameshvara can be split as Ramaa- Ishvara, meaning, the Lord of Ramaa (Goddess Lakshmi) who is Lord Vishnu. Thus this can also mean that Kalidasa is praying to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu who are Pitharau (fathers) to this Jagath who are inseparable like the word and the meaning.

  <summary><strong>Commentary</strong></summary>
  <p>

A life without hardships, an end that is peaceful and a journey that is filled with devotion to you dear Lord. That is what is wished in this prayer, which says – O Lord Shiva, grant me, out of compassion these 3 wishes:
  </p>

  <br>
1) A painless, peaceful trouble-free death<br>
2) A life without shortage for my basic needs (as long as I am alive, please let me have the dignity to be able to live a life where I do not have to go beg for resources from others. Let there be enough when I truly need it in my life).<br>
3) A life filled with total, unwavering devotion towards you and when my soul leaves this body, I must only remember you.<br>

  <br>
  <p>

The 3rd request is key. When my soul leaves this body, I must only remember you.
Because if you don’t remember the Lord at the moment of death, it means you are
remembering something else. And whatsoever, whosoever we remember at the moment
of death has a direct impact on where we end up in the next birth. Lord Krishna
states this clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 8: Verse 6:
  </p>

yaṃ yaṃ vāpi smaranbhāvaṃ tyajatyante kalevaram<br>
taṃ tamevaiti kaunteya sadā tadbhāvabhāvitaḥ<br>
  <p>

Whosoever, at the end, leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being
only he goes, O son of Kunti, because of his constant thought of that being.
  </p>
  <p>

For most people, as the body is about to die, there is usually pain, sometimes
extreme. There is fear, worry. There is loss of memory, loss of consciousness.
Or there is a deep concern for loved ones, property, business etc, etc. We can
now see how difficult it is to remember God at that time. Especially at the
final moment, at that last breath. Therefore one has to start thinking of the
Lord or repeating his Name, as early as possible in life so that it becomes a
deep-rooted habit. Now, one might think, I will start thinking of the Lord once
I am older and closer to death. It doesn’t work that way. The mind forms deep
channels of whatever habitual thoughts repeat themselves. Therefore Iswhara
Smaranam – remembering the Lord has to be done continuously. That’s why Hindus
name their children after God, so that each time they call them, knowingly or
unknowingly they are calling the Lord’s name. As we make it a habit to take
frequent breaks during the day to remember His form or remember His name, or
remember His attributes, it slowly gets ingrained in us. Even in our sleep when
we start to see the Lord in our dreams, that is a good sign. After all, death is
nothing but an extended sleep between births. Thus, the only way to remember the
Lord at the exact moment of death, is to practice doing it continuously now.
Hence we pray for a life filled with devotion. This prayer is a great way to
remember the Lord.
  </p>

    Also referred to as Drona Sthuthi, ascribing it to the prayer of the great Sri
    Dronacharya to Lord Krishna. Other references ascribe this prayer as Sri
    Vidhura’s to Lord Krishna.
