<p>From the forest of his matted lock, water flows and wets his neck, On
which hangs the greatest of snake-like a garland, And his drum
incessantly plays damat, damat, damat, damat, And Shiva is engaged in
the very vigorous manly dance, To bless and shower, prosperity on all of
us.</p>

<p>The celestial river agitatedly moving through his matted hair, Which
makes his head shine with those soft waves, And his forehead shining
like a brilliant fire-daga daga, And the crescent of moon which is an
ornament to his head, Makes my mind love him each and every second.</p>

<p>When will I live the life of pleasure, meditating on Shiva, Sitting
near a hollow place near the celestial river Ganga, Releasing all my bad
thoughts and with hands clasped above my head, After releasing all
passion for the pretty women with shifting eyes?</p>

daily by man, Will make him pure, eternal, And he would get devotion to
Shiva leading him to salvation, For remembering Lord Shiva, is a sure
method of removal of detachment.</p>
