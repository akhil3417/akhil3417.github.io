  <summary>Description and Glory of Guru</summary>
<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>Guru Ashtakam beautifully exemplifies the necessity of a Guru,
beseeching the spiritual seeker to bow down to the Lotus Feet of the
Guru. Composed by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. GuruAshtakam is an octet in
the praise of spiritual Guru, composed by Adi Sankaracharya. Originally,
Adi Shankara has written this in praise of his Guru Govinda Pada. He
emphasizes that without deep devotion to the spiritual teacher, all our
attainments are meaningless. In Hinduism, a Guru is a spiritual teacher
who imparts the higher knowledge of the Vedas and the way of achieving
liberation (enlightenment). But mere study of books cannot make one a
Guru. One who has studied the Vedas, and who has direct knowledge of
Atman (soul) through self-realization can only be enrolled as a Guru. A
Guru is knowledgeable, self-realized, liberated, chaste, virtuous,
austere, truthful, detached, free from lust and delusion, and dedicated
and devoted to God. <strong>A Guru is the knower of Brahman.</strong> A
Guru is God in human form. The words of a Guru are like the words of
God.</p>
<p><a href="https://shlokam.org/gurubrahma/">A popular Hindu prayer
declares</a>, “The Guru is Brahma, the Guru is Vishnu, the Guru is
Shiva, the Guru is verily the Supreme Absolute itself. To that Guru, I
offer my salutations.”</p>
<p>Paying respects to a Guru, touching the feet of a Guru, serving the
Guru and taking care of his personal needs, praising and appreciating a
Guru, seeking the blessings of a Guru, remembering and meditating on the
name of a Guru, are the parts of Hindu spiritual traditions. But it
doesn't insist that everyone should have a Guru in physical form. In
Hinduism, there is a provision to consider a sacred scripture, a deity
or our very Self as our guide and Guru and develop a mental and
intuitive connection with them. With the help of concentration,
austerities and self-purification, we can strengthen our faith in our
personal Guru of the subtle realm and seek his help either to introduce
us to a real Guru, or lead us towards light, knowledge and
immortality.</p>
<h1 id="glory-of-a-guru">Glory of a Guru</h1>
<p>According to the Vedas, Lord Vishnu imparted teachings to the sages
in ancient times. Starting from the beginning, Lord Vishnu taught Lord
Brahma, who in turn taught Sage Vyasa, who in turn taught Sage Shuka; a
succession of Gurus and disciples has proceeded down through the ages
through Shri Shankaracharya to the present. A Guru is absolutely
necessary for every aspirant in the spiritual path. God is the goal,
whereas Guru is the path.</p>
<p>All great ones had their teachers. All the sages, saints, prophets,
world-teachers, incarnations, great men, however great they might have
been, had their own Gurus. Shvetaketu learnt the nature of Truth from
Uddalaka, Maitreyi from Yagnavalkya, Bhirgu from Varuna, Narada from
Sanatkumara, Nachiketas from Yama, Indra from Prajapati; and several
others humbly went to the wise ones, observed strict brahmacharya,
practiced rigorous discipline and learnt the science of God from them.
Even the incarnation of Lord himself, like Lord Krishna, sat at the feet
of his Guru Sandeepani. Lord Rama had Guru Vasishtha, Lord Hanuman had
Guru Surya (the Sun God). The Devas (celestial beings) have Brihaspati
as their Guru, and even the greatest among the divine beings sat at the
feet of Guru Dakshinamurti.</p>
<p>The scriptures are like a forest. There are ambiguous passages. There
are passages that are apparently contradictory. There are passages that
have esoteric meanings, diverse significance, and hidden explanations.
There are cross-references. One is in need of a Guru or a preceptor who
will explain to him the right meaning, who will remove doubts and
ambiguities, and who will place before him the essence of the
teachings.</p>
